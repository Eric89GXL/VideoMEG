There are many reasons why you want to record a video (and audio) from your patient/subject during an MEG procedure:  

1. Video helps to detect many problems:
  - subject's movements
  - subject's failure to maintain a proper head position inside the sensor helmet
  - subject's failure to attend to the operator's instructions thus reducing the risk of misinterpreting the MEG signals.  
2. Video can provide additional information about the subject's physiological state. For example, it allows detecting whether the subject is awake or asleep. It can even provide some hints about the sleep stage, such as changes of breathing pattern that accompany REM stage.  
3. Video allows monitoring the subject's performance in various tasks, such as overt picture naming.
4. Video is particularly useful in MEG examinations of epilepsy patients because it allows to document behavioural patterns, both ictal and iterictal, accompanying abnormal neuromagnetic activity.  
5. Video can facilitate getting feedback from your subject. You can review the video together with the subject after the recording to get a more accurate description of what was happening.  
6. Video has been routinely used for decades in conjuction with EEG, which is in many senses similar to MEG.
