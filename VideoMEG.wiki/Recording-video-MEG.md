### Assembling the hardware
To get the video recording running, first you need to assemble a video-recording computer, also called AV (for Audio-Visual) computer. AV computer is basically a normal PC with a microphone and one or more FireWire cameras connected to it. It is completely separate from your MEG device; the only link between the two is the cable that connects the parallel port output of the AV computer to the trigger input of the MEG for the synchronization purposes. All the necessary hardware (computer, cameras, cables, etc.) are relatively inexpensive off-the-shelf products, and the assembly is pretty straightforward. You can find more details [here](Assembling-the-video-recording-hardware).  

### Installing the software
Once you assembled the AV computer, you need to install Ubuntu Linux operating system and video recording software You can find the installation instructions [here](Installing-the-video-recording-software).  

### Performing the recording
Once the AV computer is set up and connected to your MEG device, you can record the audio and video of your subject during the MEG measurement. You control the video recording (i.e. start and stop the recording, adjust the cameras' shutter/gain/other parameters, etc.) from the AV computer independently of the MEG acquisition. That is, if you want the video of the subject recorded during a certain MEG session, you have to start the recording at the beginning of the session and stop it at the end of the session manually. The AV computer records the video and audio in on it's local hard drive in [it's own file format](File-format-description).
