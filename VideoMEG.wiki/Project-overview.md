To add video/audio recordings of the subject to your MEG experiment, you need two things:  
 1. Tools for recording video and audio of the subject in a way that is synchronized to the MEG data, and  
 2. Tools for analyzing these recordings.  

The Helsinki VideoMEG Project's goal is to provide the both sets of tools to you (or more stricly speaking, to teach you how to get these tools, since, for obvious reasons, you will have to obtain and assemble the hardware yourself). The project aims at being MEG vendor- and device-neutral (although, for practical reasons, it currently provides better support for Elekta Vectorview and Triux systems).
